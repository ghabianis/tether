#+title: Todo

* TODO Now [2/2]
** DONE Fix cursor [0/0]
*** DONE not in front of text
*** DONE newline fucks it up
** DONE next line is not starting at the right Y
we use =max_glyph_h= as the Y advance
but this is not correct
it needs to take into account glyphs that have their y origin lower
for example in the glyph 'y'
i think this might be the 'descent' font metric
* TODO Later [/]
** TODO don't render spaces/tabs/newlines (any empty height or width glyphs)
** TODO Egui for debugging?
** TODO create deinit function for renderer/editor
* TODO Moonshot [/]
