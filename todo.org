#+title: Todo

* TODO Now [0/5]
** TODO fix pair cursor highlighting
i fucked it up somehow
** TODO Status line
*** BRAINSTORM
- what we want ::
  - current file path relative to project root
  - current line / col
  - vim mode

** TODO sweep thru code for objc memory leaks
there are probably lots of places where i am not freeing objc objects
** TODO bug: =cc= (change line) should preserve line and not delete it entirely
* TODO Later [0/11]
** TODO (refactor) coalesce the text geometry building code for =build_text_geometry()= and =build_line_number_geometry()=
** TODO (perf) only build line number geometry for lines we see
** TODO (perf) only build text geometry for text we see?
** TODO (bug) cursor on ligature glyph should render the regular glyph on top of cursor
** TODO (feat) add new ligatures to atlas when encountered
easiest to rebuild atlas from scratch again

later can do this off main thread so rendering isn't interrupted
** TODO (perf) don't render/rebuild geometry if not needed
especially right now we rebuild all text when moving cursor as ez way to redraw cursor since it depends on text position

now we this charIdxToVertexIdx map we create in create_text_geometry, we can save this and use it to get their
vertices of a given char, so we can redraw the crusor without having to call =create_text_geometry= again.
** TODO (perf) don't output existing glyphs in the atlas
some ligatures like =//= and =///= reuse the same glyph
but we are being lazy and not checking for this and adding redundant glyphs to the atlas
** TODO event loop or some mechanism to do work without stalling frame
** TODO create deinit function for renderer/editor
** TODO Egui for debugging?
** TODO curves svg etc
* Archive
** DONE Fix cursor [0/0]
*** DONE not in front of text
*** DONE newline fucks it up
** DONE next line is not starting at the right Y
we use =max_glyph_h= as the Y advance
but this is not correct
it needs to take into account glyphs that have their y origin lower
for example in the glyph 'y'
i think this might be the 'descent' font metric
