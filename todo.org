#+title: Todo

* TODO Now [2/5]
** DONE don't render spaces/tabs/newlines (any empty height or width glyphs)
** DONE fix backspace on newline
** TODO Vim [0/3]
*** TODO modes [2/4]
**** DONE normal [2/2]
***** DONE up/down/left/right
***** DONE $, 0, A, a
**** TODO visual [2/4]
***** DONE selection logic
***** DONE yank
***** TODO draw selection [3/4]
****** DONE compute top/left/bot/right points for each line
****** DONE push those as vertices
****** DONE reuse the text/cursor render pass to draw. use cursor texel coords
****** TODO Fix selection overlap bug
***** TODO bug: selection changing sides not correct
**** DONE insert
*** TODO chaining movements
*** TODO moving up/down lines preserves word column when possible
example:
#+begin_src zig
pub fn start_of_line(self: *Self) void {
    self.cursor.col = 0;
    self.draw_text = true;
}
#+end_src

if cursor is at =s= in =start_of_line= (index 7)

when going down, cursor will try to be on index 7 if possible, if not then the greatest char possible
** TODO Cursor position messed up for glyphs with low origin
ex:
#+begin_src
FUCK(y
o__y
#+end_src
if cursor is on =(=, =y=, or =_= then the cursor is
translated a bit lower
** TODO last line cursor bug
#+begin_src
FUCK THIS SHIT MAN
nice
no
way
#+end_src
On the last line in normal mode the cursor can still be on the newline, why?

* TODO Later [0/3]
** TODO Egui for debugging?
** TODO create deinit function for renderer/editor
** TODO curves svg etc
* Archive
** DONE Fix cursor [0/0]
*** DONE not in front of text
*** DONE newline fucks it up
** DONE next line is not starting at the right Y
we use =max_glyph_h= as the Y advance
but this is not correct
it needs to take into account glyphs that have their y origin lower
for example in the glyph 'y'
i think this might be the 'descent' font metric
