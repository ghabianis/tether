#+title: Todo

* TODO Now [5/7]
** DONE don't render spaces/tabs/newlines (any empty height or width glyphs)
** DONE fix backspace on newline
** TODO Vim [2/4]
*** DONE support =Key= and not just chars (change CharParser to KeyParser)
*** DONE support delete/change/yank + movement
*** TODO support w/W/b/B/e/E
*** TODO moving up/down lines preserves word column when possible
example:
#+begin_src zig
pub fn start_of_line(self: *Self) void {
    self.cursor.col = 0;
    self.draw_text = true;
}
#+end_src

if cursor is at =s= in =start_of_line= (index 7)

when going down, cursor will try to be on index 7 if possible, if not then the greatest char possible
** TODO bug: semicolon texture fucked up

* TODO Later [0/4]
** TODO Egui for debugging?
** TODO create deinit function for renderer/editor
** TODO curves svg etc
* Archive
** DONE Fix cursor [0/0]
*** DONE not in front of text
*** DONE newline fucks it up
** DONE next line is not starting at the right Y
we use =max_glyph_h= as the Y advance
but this is not correct
it needs to take into account glyphs that have their y origin lower
for example in the glyph 'y'
i think this might be the 'descent' font metric
