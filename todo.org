** TODO Vim [0/3]
*** TODO modes [2/4]
**** DONE normal [2/2]
***** DONE up/down/left/right
***** DONE $, 0, A, a
**** TODO visual [/]
***** TODO draw selection
**** DONE insert [0/0]
*** TODO chaining movements
*** TODO moving up/down lines preserves word column when possible
example:
#+begin_src zig
pub fn start_of_line(self: *Self) void {
    self.cursor.col = 0;
    self.draw_text = true;
}
#+end_src

if cursor is at =s= in =start_of_line= (index 7)

when going down, cursor will try to be on index 7 if possible, if not then the greatest char possible

** DONE Fix cursor [0/0]
*** DONE not in front of text
*** DONE newline fucks it up
** DONE next line is not starting at the right Y
we use =max_glyph_h= as the Y advance
but this is not correct
it needs to take into account glyphs that have their y origin lower
for example in the glyph 'y'
i think this might be the 'descent' font metric
